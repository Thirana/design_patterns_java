## Behavioral Design Patterns

**Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.**

### Strategy design pattern

- when you want to use different variants of an algorithm within an object and be able to switch from one algorithm to another during runtime.
- when you have a lot of similar classes that only differ in the way they execute some behavior.
- to isolate the business logic of a class from the implementation details of algorithms that may not be as important in the context of that logic.
